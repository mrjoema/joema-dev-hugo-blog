Frequent changes in data requirements make it critical to have an infrastructure that enables rapid iteration without sacrificing stability or scalability. While working with a 10+ engineer organization, I saw an opportunity to unify and modernize our approach. By framing the technical vision and guiding the architectural direction, we rebuilt the data pipeline infrastructure from the ground up—scaling it to meet current needs and anticipate future growth.

Limited Data Pipeline Expertise Across the Organization With most engineers coming from full-stack backgrounds, pipelines were often implemented without best practices—leading to slow runs, fragile error handling, and minimal operational insights. The image above shows the then-current pipeline landscape. As you can see, cross-project leverage was minimal, and each pipeline operated in isolation—often reinventing the same data pipeline logic. This fragmentation resulted in inconsistent standards and noticeable discrepancies in pipeline quality.
