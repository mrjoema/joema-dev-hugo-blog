<p>In Big Tech companies, <strong>processing massive volumes of data for annotation</strong> is essential for model training and model evaluation with human preferences (<strong>RLHF</strong>). Frequent changes in data requirements make it critical to have an <strong>infrastructure that enables rapid iteration</strong> without sacrificing stability or scalability.</p>
<p>While working with the eng organization, I observed recurring inefficiencies in our existing approach and initiated a series of alignment meetings to define a shared <em>technical vision</em> and <em>architectural direction</em>. Once aligned, each engineer took ownership of a specific area of the plan, enabling parallel implementation. Through this coordinated effort, we <strong>rebuilt the data pipeline infrastructure from the ground up</strong>â€”scaling it to meet current needs and anticipate future growth.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
