## About Me
I’m a software engineer with a career spanning **product engineering with backend / fullstack development**.

I began in mobile and web development, building end-to-end features with a focus on user impact and reliability. Over time, I expanded into MLOps and later fintech backend engineering, delivering high-performance systems for payments and money movement. 

Today, I specialize in **AI/ML data infrastructure**, designing scalable pipelines and platforms that power large-scale model training and evaluation (RLHF). My strength lies in blending **product-driven thinking** with **infrastructure excellence** — ensuring that what we build not only works at scale, but drives real business value.

### Areas of Expertise
